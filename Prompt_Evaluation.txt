Prompt: 
You are a data science tutor. Summarize the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in under 150 words using bullet points suitable for beginners.
Evaluation: 
## Prompt Evaluation:

**1. Clarity:** 7/10 - The prompt clearly states the desired outcome: summarizing the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. However, it could be clearer by providing a brief explanation of what these types of learning are before asking for a summary.  
**2. Specificity:** 6/10 - The prompt specifies that the summary should be under 150 words, but lacks detail regarding the specific focus (e.g., differences in algorithm, applications, etc.). 
**3. Output Format and Constraints:** 8/10 -  The prompt explicitly requests a bullet point list suitable for beginners. It also sets a word count limit of 150 words. 
**4. Persona defined:** 2/10 - The prompt doesn't assign a specific persona to the assistant, leaving the role undefined.


**Final Score: 6/10**  The prompt is clear in its goal but lacks detail and specificity regarding the scope of learning and target audience. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
* **Add context:** Briefly explain supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning before requesting a summary.
* **Specify focus:** Include a specific focus area (e.g., algorithm differences, applications, etc.) to ensure the summary remains relevant.

Prompt: 
“You are an expert. Explain how this works.”
Evaluation: 
## Prompt Evaluation:

**1. Clarity (8/10):** The prompt is clear in its intent, asking for an explanation of something ("how this works"). However, it lacks a specific topic or context. 
**2. Specificity (4/10):**  The prompt doesn't provide any details about the subject matter, making it difficult to understand what "this" refers to. It needs explicit information on the concept, process, or object being explained.
**3. Output Format and Constraints (0/10):** The prompt does not specify the desired format for the output (e.g., bullet points, paragraph, answer in a specific tone). 
**4. Persona defined (7/10):**  The prompt implicitly defines a persona as an "expert" who can provide explanations. However, it lacks a clear indication of the level of expertise or the intended audience.

**Overall Score: 5/10** The prompt demonstrates some clarity but suffers from lack of specificity and missing output format constraints. It also needs to define the persona more clearly.


## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Specify the topic:**  Add a sentence like "Explain how [specific technology/process] works."
* **Define output format:** Specify if you want a short explanation, a detailed answer, or something else.

Prompt:
 “You are a space historian. Tell me everything you know about space.”
Evaluation:
 Here's an evaluation of the user prompt:

**1. Clarity — 8/10** 
The prompt is clear in stating that the user wants information on "space" from a historical perspective.  It could be clearer by specifying what "everything" entails (e.g., "Tell me everything you know about the history of space exploration").

**2. Specificity — 4/10** 
The prompt lacks specific details about the scope and focus of the historical information. What time period is being considered?  What aspects of space are most relevant (astronomy, physics, technology)?

**3. Output Format and Constraints — 5/10** 
The prompt doesn't specify the desired format for the response or any constraints on length or tone. 

**4. Persona defined — 6/10** 
The prompt explicitly assigns a persona: "You are a space historian."  However, it could be strengthened by specifying the level of expertise expected (e.g., "you are an expert in early space exploration").


**Overall Score (Final Scope) : 6/10**

The prompt is clear in its intent but lacks specificity and constraints on output format and persona, impacting its overall score.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Specify a time period or focus:**  "Tell me about the history of space exploration from the early days of rocketry to the first manned mission to Mars."
* **Define desired tone/format:** "Write a concise overview of space history as if you were writing an introductory textbook chapter, focusing on the scientific advancements and their impact on society."

Prompt:
 “You are a product analyst. Given the following customer reviews, extract the top three recurring complaints and propose two actionable improvements for each.”
Evaluation:
 ## Prompt Evaluation:

**1. Clarity (9/10):** The prompt clearly states the user's desired outcome - extracting top complaints from customer reviews and proposing improvement ideas. 
**2. Specificity (7/10):**  It specifies the role of the assistant ("product analyst") and provides a context for analysis ("customer reviews"). However, it lacks specifics about the type of product or industry to ensure accurate complaint extraction. 
**3. Output Format and Constraints (6/10):** The prompt does not specify the desired output format (e.g., bullet points, table, etc.) or any length constraints for the proposed improvements. 
**4. Persona defined (8/10):**  The prompt clearly assigns a persona to the assistant - "You are a product analyst." This helps guide the response generation towards a professional and analytical approach.

**Final Score: 7/10** The prompt is generally clear, but lacks specific details about the context and desired output format.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Specify the Product/Industry:**  Add information about the type of product (e.g., software, food, clothing) or industry to ensure relevant complaints are extracted. 
* **Define Output Format:** Specify whether the response should be in bullet points, a table, or a detailed report with specific sections for each complaint and improvement idea. 


**Note:**  The prompt could benefit from additional context to improve clarity and specificity.

Prompt:
 “You are a sci‑fi novelist. Write a short story (under 200 words) about a robot discovering an extinct human civilization, focusing on emotional tone rather than action.”
Evaluation:
 ## Prompt Evaluation:

**1. Clarity:** 9 - The prompt clearly states the desired task (write a short story) and provides specific constraints (sci-fi genre, word count).  It also gives context for the theme (emotional tone) and target audience (a robot discovering an extinct human civilization). 
**2. Specificity:** 7 - While the prompt specifies the genre and word count, it lacks details about the setting, characters, or specific emotional themes to be explored.  It would benefit from more concrete details about the robot's perspective and the nature of the discovered civilization. 
**3. Output Format and Constraints:** 8 - The prompt explicitly states "short story" (under 200 words) and provides a clear target for length. It also establishes a specific tone ("emotional").
**4. Persona defined:** 6 -  The prompt does not assign a specific persona to the assistant, but it implicitly suggests the role of a sci-fi novelist by using phrases like "you are a sci-fi novelist."


**Final score: 7.5 / 10**

Overall, the prompt is clear and concise in outlining the task, with some room for improvement in terms of specificity regarding setting and emotional themes.  


## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Add specific details about the robot:** What kind of robot is it? What are its limitations and capabilities? Does it have a name or personality?
* **Describe the extinct civilization's impact on the robot:** How does discovering this civilization affect the robot emotionally, physically, or intellectually? 


By adding these elements, the prompt will become more comprehensive and provide a clearer direction for the story.
